# Raytracer

This project is mainly being done because I want to learn how to leverage capabilities that modern compilers and hardware provide today.
In particular, I want to focus on two main things:

1. **SIMD** In particular, raytracer-core is heavily based on SIMD optimizations (*TODO*), utilizing compiler vector intrinsics
2. **GPU** (May be done in future, probably using CUDA)

*TODO* Below, in a nutshell about every piece of the engine
